        <h3>The Rocket Launch Revolution: From Sputnik Upward</h3>
        <div>Since the launch of Sputnik in 1957, access to space has grown rapidly, reaching over 100 launches a year within 2 decades.
        The cold war became a major driving force for space exploration, with the United States and the Soviet Union competing to be the first to reach the moon in the late 60s.
        With the cold war winding up in the late 80s and early 90s and the collapse of the Soviet Union, the number of launches dropped, with this trend continuing into the 2000s.
        However, in the last decade, the number of launches has been increasing, with the advent of commericial space companies such as SpaceX and Blue Origin leading a second space race.

          <h3>A global phenomenom</h3>
          <p>Whilst the USA and Russia have long lead the way in Space Launches, they're not alone in their domination of Space. Many countries around the world have been home to a space launch, from India to New Zealand, Kenya to Australia. The USA and Russia's lead is still unsurpassed however new contenders in the space arena are leaving their mark</p>

Access to space over time though shows a clear upward trend and it can be seen that in 2019, the spread of launches between countries is trending upwards.</p>

        <h3>Success: Nominal</h3>
        <p>We've come a long way in terms of space travel, with the reliability of our rockets increasing dramatically since 1957. In 1959, we had more failures than successes, however over the last 40 years, the success rate has grown dramatically whilst simultaneously the price of rocket launches has decreased by an order of magnitude. Nowadays, the sky is no longer the limit.</p>

        <h3>Modern Day Workhorses</h3>
        <p>When looking at the most launched rockets over time, you see a stark delimination when comparing currently active rockets with retired rockets. When only looking at the most popular active rockets, there's a broad spread from multiple different countries including China, Russia, America and Europe. Looking at the most popular rockets of all time however shows just how dominant Russia was in the Space Race. All historically popular rockets bar the Ariane 5, the only active rocket to make the list, are Russian made, with the Cosmos-3M rocket launching nearly 450 times!  </p>

        <h3>From Zero to Orbit: The Meteoric Ascent of SpaceX</h3>
        <p>With humble beginnings and overcoming a shaky start, SpaceX has cemented themselves as one of the most successful space launch companies in recent years. Their Falcon 9 rocket has single-handedly lead to a resurgance in the space race, sparking what many consider to be tha advent of the commercial space race. One clear indicator of their success is analyzing their payload capacity over time, with the number of launches increasing, as well as their maximum payload capacity more than doubling since their first launch in 2012. On top of that, their Falcon Heavy rocket has allowed larger payloads to higher orbits than ever possible, claiming the crown as the most powerful rocket currently active in the world!</p>

        <h3>Revolution in Reuse</h3>
        <p>They key to SpaceX's success has revolved around their ability to propulsively land, recover and reuse their boosters, the first company in the world to do so. This has allowed SpaceX to lower the price of each launch and become more competitive than legacy rocket launch companies such as ULA. SpaceX have become so successful at reusing boosters, they have reused multiple boosters over 15 times! One such booster, <mark class="booster1">B1060</mark>, flew for a total of 15 flights, completing 5 of these in as little as a 6 month timeframe. 
        SpaceX have become so efficient at reusing boosters that for one flight on <mark class="booster2">B1073</mark>, they managed to refly the booster just 1 month after landing it. This development has allowed SpaceX to become the most cost effective rocket launch company in the world, with their Falcon 9 rocket costing just $62 million per launch, compared to the $350 million per launch of the Delta IV Heavy rocket.

        <h3>A Foundation for Success</h3>
        <p>SpaceX's ability to launch, land and recover their rockets with almost 100% success sets them apart however the competition it has sparked sets the stage for a new space race, all in the hope of furthering Human's reach into space. <br><br>As we stand at the precipice of venturing beyond our home planet, aiming to explore and potentially colonize distant worlds, it's imperative to take a moment to trace the arc of our celestial journey. Our past, marked by the tension of the Cold War, became the catalyst for monumental achievements like the moon race. These early expeditions laid the groundwork, setting humanity on a trajectory that would redefine what's possible. Now, as we transition into the present, companies like SpaceX are not just continuing the legacy but revolutionizing it, marrying ambition with innovation. Their trailblazing efforts signify a pivotal moment in our cosmic saga, suggesting that our future, more than ever before, is studded with stars and infinite possibilities. As we move forward, the chronicles of our past serve as both a compass and inspiration, reminding us that the horizon of the final frontier is only just beginning to unfold.</p>
